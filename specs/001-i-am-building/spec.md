# Feature Specification: Modern DevOps Portfolio Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am building modern portfolio website for DevOps advanced engineer. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with 3 featured projects from GitLab.
There should be a GitLab projects page, a knowledge page, and contact page. Should have 50 projects, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from real feed, the same related to knowledge page."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a DevOps engineer or recruiter, I want to quickly understand the engineer's key projects and expertise from a sleek portfolio so I can assess fit or get inspired.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the landing page, when I view it, then I see exactly 3 featured GitLab projects with title, brief summary, and call-to-action to view more.
2. Given the projects page, when I browse the grid, then I can see a list of 50 mocked projects with consistent metadata (title, tags, short description) and pagination or lazy-load that clearly indicates coverage of 50 items.
3. Given the knowledge page, when I open it, then I can browse mocked knowledge entries organized by category or tag, with clear search or filter affordance.
4. Given the contact page, when I open it, then I can see clear contact options (e.g., email link and/or simple form) and a confirmation state after sending.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a featured project is missing metadata? The section should gracefully hide the missing field and still render the card.
- How does the system handle empty knowledge or projects list? Show a friendly empty state with guidance.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The landing page MUST display exactly 3 featured GitLab projects with title, summary, and a link to details.
- FR-002: The projects page MUST present 50 mocked projects with consistent fields (title, brief description, tags) for browsing.
- FR-003: The knowledge page MUST present mocked entries organized for discoverability (by category or tag) and allow basic filtering or search.
- FR-004: The contact page MUST provide at least one working contact method and show a confirmation state upon submission.
- FR-005: Navigation MUST allow access to landing, projects, knowledge, and contact pages from any page.
- FR-006: Visual design MUST convey a modern, sleek aesthetic consistent across pages, including responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
- FR-007: Content MUST be mock data only; no live GitLab or external feed integration for this version.
- FR-008: All pages MUST load successfully without JavaScript enabled for core content visibility [aligns with static site principles].
- FR-009: Each page MUST include basic SEO elements (page title, meta description, open graph image placeholder).
- FR-010: Accessibility MUST meet a11y basics: semantic headings, alt text for images, sufficient contrast.
- FR-011: Performance goals: main pages should feel fast with lightweight assets suitable for static hosting.

- FR-012: System MUST clarify selection criteria for featured projects [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who chooses the 3 featured items and on what basis?].
- FR-013: Projects page MUST indicate how users reach project detail views [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: separate detail pages vs. modal vs. external GitLab links?].
- FR-014: Knowledge page MUST define taxonomy [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: categories, tags, or both?].
- FR-015: Contact page MUST define preferred contact mode [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: mailto link, embedded form, or external service?].

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- Project: title, summary, tags, featured flag, link to details.
- Knowledge Entry: title, category/tag, summary, link to full content (mocked).
