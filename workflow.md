I am building modern portfolio website for DevOps advanced engineer. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with 3 featured projects from GitLab. 
There should be a GitLab projects page, a knowledge page, and contact page. Should have 50 projects, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from real feed, the same related to knowledge page.
