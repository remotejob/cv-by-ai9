Fill the constitution with the bare minimum regiments for a static web app based on the template.

I am building modern portfolio website for DevOps advanced engineer. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. Should have a landing page with 3 featured projects from GitLab. 
There should be a GitLab projects page, a knowledge page, and contact page. Should have 50 projects, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from real feed, the same related to knowledge page. 


For things that need clarification, use the best guest you think is reasonable. Update acceptance checklist after.

Everything you do must be oriented on Cloudflare!!

/plan I am going use Next.js with static site configuration, no databases - data is embedded in the content for mock Projects and Knowledge. Site is responsive and ready for mobile.
for design I will use example from Figma https://www.figma.com/design/c2vH3MCGEEx3C1CYcjv0df/Developer-s-Portfolio--Community-?node-id=2-2&t=cwgDApVLQS0viNeq-4 Using MCP Server Framelink_Figma_MCP as well shadcn free components by MCP server shadcn


/tasks break this down into tasks
